# Face_Mask_Detection
This project aims to make sure everyone wears a mask and to request them to wear if they are not wearing masks.
We have trained the model for detecting masks in the face and we have used it to detect masks during video streaming. 
We have used python libraries like Keras, TensorFlow, OpenCV, imutils, NumPy, etc., to create this.
